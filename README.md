# Eat! App Overview

Our team started this app from scratch and learned Java to create this app. We wanted to challenge ourselves and learn new skills as programmers. As college students, we
could relate to buying groceries and struggling with keeping up with our food inventory and expiration dates to save money and time. 

This app to keep track of all your grocery list and inventory. You can add items to a grocery list and inventory and the app can recommmend recipes to you based on your 
pantry's inventory. We wanted to make it easier for people who forget what they need when they arrive at the grocery store and help them eat well with ingredients they 
have. Food is not only good for the body but also the mind. :)

# Development Environment

To create this app, we used Android Studio. Since only a couple of us had a Mac computer, we decided to create an Android app in Java so we could all contribute. Java
is a sophisticated object-oriented programming language that is often used for web applications. Many of the libraries/features we added into the app were taken from
Android Studio. We did not download any libraries.
